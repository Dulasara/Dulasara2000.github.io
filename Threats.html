  <h1>Why Is the Endangerment of Sea Turtles? Five Big Threats</h1>
  
  <div class="section">
    <h2>FISHERIES BY CATCH</h2>
    <img src="fisheries.jpg" alt="FISHERIES BY CATCH">
    <p>Thousands to tens of thousands of sea turtles are thought to perish each year as a result of the fishing business. Turtles caught in gill nets, trawls, and longlines are discarded as bycatch. Additionally, the disruption to their food supply and environment has an effect on those who are able to evade fishing nets.</p>
    
  </div>
  
  <div class="section">
    <h2>COASTAL DEVELOPMENT</h2>
    <img src="coastal.jpg" alt="COASTAL DEVELOPMENT">
    <p>Because of receding coasts, sea turtle habitats are devastated every year. Sea turtle food sources and nesting areas are severely impacted anywhere there is boat vessel traffic, anytime a new hotel or high-rise is built up along the shore, and everywhere the sea floor is dug up and the beach erodes.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="section">
    <h2>POLLUTION AND PATHOGENS</h2>
    <img src="pollution.jpg" alt="POLLUTION AND PATHOGENS">
    <p>Sea turtles are frequently harmed by marine pollution. Sea turtles are injured by ingestion and entanglement due to plastic pollution, fishing gear left behind, petroleum byproducts, and other debris. In addition to disrupting nesting behavior and hatchling orientation, ocean pollution can impair the turtles' immune systems.

    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
            <h2>DIRECT TAKE</h2>
            <img src="direct take.jpg" alt="DIRECT TAKE">
            <p>Turtles are murdered and sold as exotic food, oil, leather, and jewelry on a global scale. Millions of hawkbill turtles have been slaughtered only for the value of their shells during the past century. And while though the global trade in luxury and handicrafts has decreased now as a result of conservation initiatives, it still poses a persistent threat to turtles in several regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
          </div>

    <div class="section">
            <h2>CLIMATE CHANGE</h2>
            <img src="climate.jpg" alt="CLIMATE CHANGE">
            <p>The extent to which sea turtles can be impacted by climate change is only now coming to light. Climate change has the potential to alter the natural sex ratios of hatchlings, raise the risk of disease outbreaks, and increase the frequency of extreme weather conditions that devastate coral reefs and beaches used for nesting.</p>
