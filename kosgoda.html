        The order Chelonii of reptiles includes turtles. Because of this, scientists and environmentalists also refer to them as chelonians. Chelonians are distinguished by their distinctive bony carapace, which grows from their ribs and serves as a shield. They are an ancient species; the earliest proto-turtles appeared more than 220 million years ago, during the Triassic Period. Turtles, tortoises, and terrapins are the three species that make up the order of Chelonii, usually referred to as the Testudines.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        In North America, the term "turtles" refers to all chelonians, such as tortoises and terrapins. However, in the UK, the turtle denotes a species of Chelonian that lives in the sea. The term typically refers to chelonians who dwell primarily in the water and have flippers.
    </p><br>  
    <p>
        The phrase "tortoises" describes non-swimming, land-dwelling chelonians. Unlike the other members of the species that have flippers, they have legs and feet.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        The term "terrapin" describes a number of species of small, edible turtles with hard shells that live their entire lives in brackish water.

    <h2>The Threat to Sea Turtles and the Causes</h2>
   <p>
    Sea life is abundant in the waters surrounding Sri Lanka. Even though there are still hazards to marine life in our area, we go above and beyond to mitigate them. Our beaches are home to five of the seven different species of sea turtles. They are all listed as endangered. The following species can be found in the waters around Sri Lanka:
   </p><br>
   <li>
    Leatherbacks:Oldest and largest marine turtles. They've existed for more than 150 million years. The typical adult weighs between 600 and 800 pounds and is between 5 and 6 feet tall. They are among the biggest living reptiles.
   </li><br>
   <li>
    Green Turtles:They can grow to a length of 4 feet and a weight of 500 pounds, making them the second-largest sea turtles. They eat just plants.
   </li><br>
   <li>
    Loggerheads:one of the largest species of turtles. They can grow up to 4 feet in length and weigh 200 to 400 pounds. Their enormous heads and powerful jaws, which are designed to consume hardshelled animals like crabs and conchs, gave them their name.
   </li><br>
   <li>
    Hawksbills:They weigh between 100 and 200 pounds and are 2-3 feet long. They fall toward the little end of the sea turtle size range.Their natural habitat is tropical oceans. Their names refer to their sharp, avian-like beaks and narrow heads. They utilize their beaks to snag prey from coral reefs, rocks, and crevices. Of all marine turtles, hawksbills are regarded as the most attractive.
   </li><br>
   <li>
    Olive Ridley Turtles:After Kemp Ridley turtles, they are the smallest. They weigh between 75 and 100 pounds and have a length of 2 to 2.5 feet. They get their name from their light green carapace. Despite being the species of sea turtle that are currently most common worldwide, they are nonetheless in danger.
