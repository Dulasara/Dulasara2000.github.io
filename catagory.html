The species is found around the world, however its range is primarily restricted to tropical and subtropical marine and estuarine habitats.</p>
            <p>The hawksbill turtle resembles other marine turtles in appearance. Its body is generally flattened, it has a protective carapace, and its limbs resemble flippers, making it well-suited for swimming in wide oceans. Because of its saw-like shell borders and sharp, curved beak with a prominent tomium, E. imbricata can be clearly identified from other sea turtles. The color of a hawksbill shell varies slightly depending on the temperature of the water. Although this turtle spends a portion of its life in the open ocean.</p>
